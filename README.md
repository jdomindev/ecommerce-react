# E-Commerce Template Site

## About this App

This website was created to be a template for users to build their own simple e-commerce site. Users of the e-commerce site can create an account, log in, select items to add to their cart, and checkout out using stripeâ€™s secure checkout process.

## Site Demo

### Credentials 

To preview the site as a guest user, these credentials may be used:

```Email: test@test.com```

```Password: password```

### Checkout

<mark>Stripe checkout is in *Test Mode* so there are no transaction costs for the user.</mark>

Use any info you like for the name and zip code section of checkout, however since this Stripe instance is in *Test Mode* you must use one of the test cards from the test card list as specified in the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards).


Here is the test Visa card:

```
Credit Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
CVC: any 3 digits
Expiration Date: any future date
```

# Installation and setup

Once the repo is forked:

1. ```run npm install``` to install all the dependencies needed.
2. Then run ```npm run start``` to start up the server and client.

To start only the backend:

1. ```npm run server```

## Forking app as template

For those who wish to use this template, all I ask is that you give me proper credit by linking back to my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jdomindev/ecommerce-react).

### Prerequisites

#### MongoDB

A [Mongo database](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database) is needed to store the product and user information. You will need create an env file and enter your own MongoDB URI. 

#### Stripe

In addition, if you plan to use Stripe for the checkout process, you will need to [create an account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) and add your public key and private key to your env file. 

#### JWT

Login authentication is handled by JSON Web Tokens. A secret is required for authentication to work. The secret can be any thing you like, just add it to the env file.

##### Example of the env file:

```
MONGODB_URI = YOUR_MONGO_URI
STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
SESSION_SECRET = YOUR_OWN_SECRET
```

## Adding Your Own Products

To add your own products you need to fill out the *productSeeds* and *categorySeeds* jsons in the *seeders* folder with your own products and categories. 

For products to have an associated category, you need to enter its ID into the product json. 
- Category IDs are generated in MongoDB after seeding the categories, so the <mark>category json should be run first.</mark> 
- It may be helpful to have MongoDB Compass installed to see the category IDs and then add those to each product.

Once a json is filled out run `npm run seed` to populate your database.
